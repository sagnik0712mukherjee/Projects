# Projects
The objectives are
To establish a template that would allow us to first establish co-relations amongst the existing scaled input features, and then, compare the suitable Machine Learning algorithms that can be deployed to perform this task along with parallel hyper parameter tuning. The comparison parameters / attributes would be: best score, best parameters, best re-fit time, split-wise score table, time of computation (backend), etc.
The most important objective is to build a web server based GUI for the client to make predictions using Python Flask Server, JavaScript, CSS and HTML. This layout can be used to make suitable predictions of the AQI, at a given future time.
This template can later be used for any model building purpose.

Future scope:
Defining a web interface for comparison of machine learning algorithms on any classification data set, where in the data set can have any types / number of features
These features will be internally treated tested and the most relevant features according to the prediction column would be displayed and also different co relations, after which upon the decided feature, multiple algorithms will be tested and the results of which will be displayed on the interface.
The project will become a tool for the companies before starting their machine learning project to seek a direction, in regards to what should be the next steps and save their time. Further an end-to-end application can work on it, by itself and yield a final model that can be directly deployed to make final predictions.
Few application domains will be in any that deal with classification / regression problems. 
The problem statements it would work upon would be:
CLASSIFICATION: Categorizing if the movie will be a success; Predicting placements for students in final years; If a certain medicine would be successful or not; Forecasting property ratesâ€™ increment or decrement in comparison to current times, etc.
REGRESSION: Predicting the sales of a company; Predicting the expected salary of placed students of an institution; Predicting the house prices or in any real estate estimator task, etc.
